# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command will install all the necessary dependencies and packages required for the project to run. It reads the package.json file and installs all dependencies listed there.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `High-Level Architecture`

1. Frontend Application (ReactJS):

The frontend of the application will be developed using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React components will be used to create different parts of the application, such as movie recommendations, movie detail view, and genre selection.

The user interface will be designed to be intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive, using modern design principles and libraries like Tailwind CSS.

2. State Management (Redux):

Redux will be used for state management in the application, providing a centralized store to manage the application's state.

Redux actions and reducers will be implemented to handle fetching movie data from the TMDB API, storing movie data, and managing user-selected genres.

Redux middleware will be used for asynchronous actions, such as fetching movie data from the API, ensuring that Redux actions can handle asynchronous operations seamlessly.

3. Data Persistence (Local Storage):

Local Storage will be integrated into the application to persist user preferences and movie data across sessions.

Upon selecting movie genres, the selected genres will be stored in Local Storage to preserve user preferences.

Movie data fetched from the TMDB API will also be stored in Local Storage to reduce API calls and improve application performance.

4. External API Integration (TMDB API):

The Movie Database (TMDB) API will be used to fetch movie data, including movie titles, descriptions, release dates, genres, ratings, and poster images.

Redux asynchronous actions will be implemented to make API requests, fetch movie data, and store it in the Redux store for easy access throughout the application.

5. UI/UX Design:

The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a focus on providing a seamless movie browsing experience.

Components will be styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design across the application.

Responsive design principles will be applied to ensure that the application is accessible and functional across different devices and screen sizes.

6. Code Quality and Documentation:

Best practices will be followed for code organization, readability, and maintainability, with descriptive variable and function names.

Proper documentation will be provided throughout the codebase to explain the purpose and functionality of different components and modules.

Comments will be added where necessary to clarify complex logic or implementation details.









### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
